# L-system-FlowerPlant-Generator

How It Works

An L-System uses a string rewriting mechanism:

    Axiom: The starting string (e.g., F).
    Production Rules: Define how characters are replaced (e.g., F â†’ FF+[+F-F-F]-[-F+F+F]).
    Iterations: Apply the rules iteratively to grow the string.
    Turtle Graphics: Interpret the string using drawing commands (e.g., F = forward, + = turn right, - = turn left).

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x or any other language supporting string manipulation and turtle graphics.
    Libraries: matplotlib, numpy (optional for advanced features).

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/l-system-flower-generator.git
cd l-system-flower-generator

Install dependencies:

    pip install matplotlib numpy

Usage

Run the script:

python lsystem_flower.py

Modify parameters in the script to change:

    Axiom: Starting pattern.
    Rules: Growth rules.
    Angle: Turning angle for the turtle.
    Iterations: Number of string rewrites.
